- Friendly prompts guide the user to choose the habitat they'd like to view.
- Input validation ensures user selects a valid habitat number or provides a convenient exit command.

## Usage

javac Main.java
```

2. Run the compiled Java program:

```bash
java Main
```

3. Follow the on-screen prompts:

```

Enter a number from 0 to 5 to view a specific animal habitat. 

To exit the program, simply type `exit` and hit Enter.

## Example Interaction

```
Please enter the number of the habitat you would like to view: > 3
Switching on the camera in the goose habitat...
...
The goose is staring intently at you... Maybe it's time to change the channel?
Please enter the number of the habitat you would like to view: > exit
See you later!
```

## Notes
